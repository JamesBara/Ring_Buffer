# STM32_USB_Ring_Buffer
 General Purpose Ring Buffer based on https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2017/05/17/creating-a-circular-buffer-in-c-and-c/.
 
 Included my implementation of the CDC_Receive_FS function for STM32 and a loopback example.
 
 Tested and working on STM32L452RE for large received data.
